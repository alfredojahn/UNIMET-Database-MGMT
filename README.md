# Database Management Proyect
#### by Alfredo Jahn & Guido Acuna

## Proyect Description
1.  In this university project we were asked to design a relational database for a hypothetical supermaket chain. The schema was designed following some specifications on how the supermarket wanted to handle its inventory, products, and 'smart' (IoT) racks and carts.
---
2.  After designing the schema we populated it with Python scripts that sent information via the MQTT Protocol, simulating the IoT technology in the carts and racks. These scripts used probability distributions to simulate clients arriving at the store, choosing products and their quantity, payment methods, etc.
---
3.  Implemented stored procedures that alerted the staff when a client left without paying, when a certain item in the rack was emptied and needed to be replenished, among others.
---
4.  After the database was populated we created reports and using Google Data Studio and Python (Pandas, SciKit) to create predictive analysis programs that allowed the store to predict how much inventory it would need at a specific time as well as expected future income.
